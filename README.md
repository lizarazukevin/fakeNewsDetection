- Date

Labels were either real or fake, corresponding to if the news articles were honest and valid.

## Build and Run
This project contains util python files and jupyter notebooks that can be easily run, to see our results check out the following notebooks and run their cells:
- naiveBayes.ipynb
- svm.ipynb

All other configurables like paths can be found in <i>config.json</i>
