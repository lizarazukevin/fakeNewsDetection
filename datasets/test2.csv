"Factbox: From taxes to budget, U.S. Congress's calendar tightens","(Reuters) - The U.S. Congress is careening toward major deadlines on a Republican tax bill, the budget and other policies. Here is the outlook for what promises to be a sprint to the end of 2017. TUESDAY, NOV 28: The Senate Budget Committee voted on Tuesday to send Republican tax-cut legislation to the Senate floor for a vote, possibly as soon as Thursday, with 51 votes needed for passage.  THURSDAY, NOV. 30, or FRIDAY, DEC. 1: Possible final Senate vote on tax bill, although delay was possible. Ahead of a floor vote, several Republican senators were making demands for possible changes to the legislation. If the Senate approves the bill, a conference would begin to reconcile differences between the Senate and House of Representatives tax measures. A compromise bill would need to be approved before going to President Donald Trump for enactment. FRIDAY, DEC. 8: Expiration date for funding needed to keep the U.S. government open. Congress has three choices: approve a massive bill for more than $1 trillion to keep the government operating through Sept. 30, 2018; pass a shorter extension of current funding to buy more time; or fail to pass anything and risk a partial government shutdown, stalling the tax effort. U.S. Treasury hits its limit on borrowing, but takes steps to postpone any need for action by Congress, eliminating any need for a debt limit increase in an end-of-year catch-all bill. TUESDAY, DEC. 12: Special U.S. Senate election in Alabama pits Republican Roy Moore, a conservative firebrand accused of sexual misconduct involving teenage girls, against Democrat Doug Jones. The election could mean trouble for the tax overhaul effort. Moore, a critic of Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, could cause turmoil if elected. A win by Jones would shrink even more Republicans’ narrow margin of Senate control. THURSDAY, DEC. 14: House’s last scheduled session of 2017.  FRIDAY, DEC. 15: Senate’s last scheduled session of 2017. FRIDAY, DEC. 22: The last weekday before Christmas and a potential deadline for sending tax legislation to Trump. DISASTER AID: On Nov. 17, the White House asked Congress to approve $44 billion in more aid for disaster-hit Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Texas, Florida and other states. If approved, as expected, aid would total nearly $96 billion. Additional requests are expected. DREAMERS: Trump has threatened to end an Obama-era program that helped “Dreamers,” people brought illegally into the United States when they were children. Trump gave Congress until early March to come up with a replacement program, but Democrats and some Republicans want to do this in December. CHIP: The Children’s Health Insurance Program, which helps millions of lower-income pregnant women and children, is running out of money. Congress has struggled to approve a five-year renewal for the program that normally enjoys bipartisan support.     ",politicsNews,28-Nov-17,real
" BREAKING: Israel’s “Worst Fears Confirmed,” Says Israeli Intelligence Official In Wake Of Trump Revelation","In a bombshell revelation, The New York Times named Israel the source of the classified information that Trump leaked to the Russian government last week.Today, an Israeli intelligence officer disclosed to BuzzFeed that Israel is very concerned about Trump actions   despite the fact that the Israeli government said they wouldn t change their intelligence relationship with the White House. We have an arrangement with America which is unique to the world of intelligence sharing,  the official explained.  We do not have this relationship with any other country There is a special understanding of security cooperation between our countries. To know that this intelligence is shared with others, without our prior knowledge? That is, for us, our worst fears confirmed. Earlier this year the same unnamed Israeli official told BuzzFeed that Israeli Intelligence had major concerns over Trump and what he might disclose to Russia   a very close ally to Israel s top adversary, Iran.The President has a visit scheduled in Israel for next week as part of a large global tour that includes Saudi Arabia and the Vatican. This might not be the best time for Trump to travel to Isreal, seeing as he may have just outed them to their biggest enemy. It will be interesting to watch how this unfolds.Photo by Michael Reynolds-Pool/Getty Images",politicsNews,16-May-17,fake
U.S. drug enforcement chief to step down from agency,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration’s acting director on Tuesday said that he will be leaving his post, two months after he criticized Republican President Donald Trump for telling law enforcement officers not to be “too nice” to suspects. Acting Director Chuck Rosenberg, a holdover from Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration, told the agency’s staff in an internal email that he will be leaving his position effective Oct. 1. “This is a remarkable agency - full of remarkable people - and I am honored to have been a small part of it,” Rosenberg said in the message, which was reviewed by Reuters. It was unclear who would replace Rosenberg. The news was first reported by The Washington Post.  A spokesman for the DEA confirmed Rosenberg’s resignation. Rosenberg had been leading the DEA in an acting capacity since 2015. Before joining the agency, he served as chief of staff to former FBI director James Comey, who Trump fired in May.  Rosenberg generated headlines earlier this year after he wrote an agency-wide email in late July challenging comments by Trump suggesting officers do away with practices like protecting the head of a suspect being put into a patrol car. Citing “an obligation to speak out when something is wrong,” Rosenberg said Trump’s remarks, delivered in New York the previous day, “condoned police misconduct regarding the treatment of individuals placed under arrest by law enforcement.” He leaves the agency at a time when the DEA is grappling with the ongoing opioid drug epidemic, which has become a major law enforcement focus of the U.S. Justice Department. Opioids, including prescription painkillers and heroin, killed more than 33,000 people in the United States in 2015, more than any year on record, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Opioids such as heroin and fentanyl - and diverted prescription pain pills - are killing people in this country at a horrifying rate,” Rosenberg said in December. “We face a public health crisis of historic proportions.” ",News,26-Sep-17,real

FCC chief plans to ditch U.S. 'net neutrality' rules,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission unveiled plans on Tuesday to repeal landmark 2015 rules that prohibited internet service providers from impeding consumer access to web content in a move that promises to recast the digital landscape. FCC chief Ajit Pai, a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump in January, said the commission will vote at a Dec. 14 meeting on his plan to rescind the so-called net neutrality rules championed by Democratic former President Barack Obama that treated internet service providers like public utilities. The rules barred broadband providers from blocking or slowing down access to content or charging consumers more for certain content. They were intended to ensure a free and open internet, give consumers equal access to web content and prevent broadband service providers from favoring their own content. The action marks a victory for big internet service providers such as AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc that opposed the rules and gives them sweeping powers to decide what web content consumers can get and at what price. It represents a setback for Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc, which had urged Pai not to rescind the rules. Netflix said Tuesday it opposed the measure to “roll back these core protections.” With three Republican and two Democratic commissioners, the move is all but certain to be approved. Trump, a Republican, expressed his opposition to net neutrality in 2014 before the regulations were even implemented, calling it a “power grab” by Obama. The White House did not immediately comment Tuesday. Pai said his proposal would prevent state and local governments from creating their own net neutrality rules because internet service is “inherently an interstate service.” The preemption is most likely to handcuff Democratic-governed states and localities that could have considered their own plans to protect consumers’ equal access to internet content. “The FCC will no longer be in the business of micromanaging business models and preemptively prohibiting services and applications and products that could be pro-competitive,” Pai said in an interview, adding that the Obama administration had sought to pick winners and losers and exercised “heavy-handed” regulation of the internet. “We should simply set rules of the road that let companies of all kinds in every sector compete and let consumers decide who wins and loses,” Pai added. Tom Wheeler, who headed the FCC under Obama and advocated for the net neutrality rules, called the planned repeal “a shameful sham and sellout. Even for this FCC and its leadership, this proposal raises hypocrisy to new heights.” AT&T, Comcast and Verizon have said that repealing the rules could lead to billions of dollars in additional broadband investment and eliminate the possibility that a future presidential administration could regulate internet pricing. Comcast said no matter what the FCC decided it would “not block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content.”  Verizon said it believed the FCC “will reinstate a framework that protects consumers’ access to the open internet, without forcing them to bear the heavy costs from unnecessary regulation.” The Internet Association, representing major technology firms including Alphabet and Facebook, said Pai’s proposal “represents the end of net neutrality as we know it and defies the will of millions of Americans.” “This proposal undoes nearly two decades of bipartisan agreement on baseline net neutrality principles that protect Americans’ ability to access the entire internet,” it said. Pai’s proposal would require internet service providers to disclose whether they allow blocking or slowing down of consumer web access or permit so-called internet fast lanes to facilitate a practice called paid prioritization of charging for certain content. Such disclosure will make it easier for another agency, the Federal Trade Commission, to act against internet service providers that fail to disclose such conduct to consumers, Pai said. The FTC could seek to bar practices that it deemed “anticompetitive” or violated antitrust rules. The FCC received more than 22 million comments. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman disclosed Tuesday he has been investigating for more than six months in a bid to learn who was behind the filing of false comments. A U.S. appeals court last year upheld the legality of the net neutrality regulations, which were challenged in a lawsuit led by telecommunications industry trade association US Telecom. The group praised Pai’s decision to remove “antiquated, restrictive regulations” to “pave the way for broadband network investment, expansion and upgrades.” The FCC’s repeal is certain to draw a legal challenge from advocates of net neutrality. Nancy Pelosi, the top U.S. House of Representatives Democrat, said the FCC move would hurt consumers and chill competition, saying the agency “has launched an all-out assault on the entrepreneurship, innovation and competition at the heart of the internet.” The planned repeal represents the latest example of a legacy achievement of Obama being erased since Trump took office in January. Trump has abandoned international trade deals, the landmark Paris climate accord and environmental protections, taken aim at the Iran nuclear accord and closer relations with Cuba, and sought repeal Obama’s signature healthcare law. Pai, who has moved quickly to undo numerous regulatory actions since becoming FCC chairman, is pushing a broad deregulatory agenda. Pai said he had not shared his plans on the rollback with the White House in advance or been directed to undo net neutrality by White House officials. The FCC under Obama regulated internet service providers like public utilities under a section of federal law that gave the agency sweeping oversight over the conduct of these companies. Language in the new proposal would give the FCC significantly less authority to oversee the web. The FCC granted initial approval to Pai’s plan in May, but had left open many key questions including whether to retain any legal requirements limiting internet providers conduct. His plan would eliminate the “internet conduct standard,” which gave the FCC far-reaching discretion to prohibit improper internet service provider practices. ",Middle-east,21-Nov-17,real
" Trump Said He Could Easily End The Bloodshed In Chicago, A New DOJ Plan Doesn’t Even Mention It","Trump has repeatedly decried the gun violence that plagues the city of Chicago, along with other Republicans and NRA-types who claim that Chicago is proof that gun laws only serve to create more bloodshed. Yet, here is Jeff Sessions, creating a program to give more federal manpower to 12 cities to help them combat violent crime and Chicago isn t one of them.The 12 cities are:The absence of Chicago and another city with a huge violent crime problem, Baltimore, is a bit surprising. Earlier this year, Donald Trump compared Chicago to Afghanistan in terms of being a war zone, and threatened to  send in the feds  if Chicago officials were unable to stop the bloodshed. He also blasted the Chicago Police Department for  not doing the job: Maybe they re not gonna have to be so politically correct. Maybe they re being overly political correct. Maybe there s something going on. But a DOJ report blistered the CPD over its use of excessive force and routine violations of the constitutional rights of residents. This is particularly true for Chicago s black and Latino residents. Furthermore, Chicago s mayor, Rahm Emannuel, has repeatedly asked for more help from the federal government to combat these problems.There s one worrying thing about this plan, too: Are DOJ officials going to work with these cities to develop broken-windows policing techniques? That doesn t work   it just leads to a higher incarceration rate for ridiculously minor crimes. It also disproportionately targets the black community, making it an inherently racist policy.In the end, though, if Chicago is such a god-awful mess, and they want the help, then why wouldn t the DOJ put Chicago on this list? It s always possible that these 12 cities are testing grounds. However, it s also possible that they think they don t need to prioritize Chicago right now because they already sent 20 agents from the the ATF, and are considering reallocating federal prosecutors.A spokesman for the DOJ says that more cities will be added later in the year. The cities on this list will not receive more federal funding, per se, but they will receive agency experts and employees to work with their governments on developing strategies for how to best fight violent crime.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,21-Jun-17,fake
"Senate panel snubs Trump's pick to run EXIM, OKs other nominees","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Banking Committee rejected U.S. President Donald Trump’s nominee to head the U.S. Export-Import Bank on Tuesday  but approved four other board nominees, enough to restore the trade bank’s full lending powers upon their confirmation by the full Senate. The committee voted 13-10 against Scott Garrett as EXIM president in a rebuke to conservatives who saw the former New Jersey Republican congressman as an ally who would keep tight controls on the government export lender.  Garrett helped lead a 2015 effort to shut down EXIM to end a source of “corporate welfare” for giant manufacturers such as Boeing Co and General Electric. After his nomination he pledged to keep the bank “fully open” but struggled to persuade senators that he now believed in the bank’s core mission of providing taxpayer-backed loans and guarantees for U.S. export transactions. “I believe he’s a principled man who simply believes in the abolishment of the bank,” said Senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota, who voted against Garrett along with South Carolina Republican Tim Scott and all Democrats on the panel. The White House’s director of legislative affairs, Marc Short, commented, “We are disappointed that the Senate Banking Committee missed this opportunity to get the Export Import Bank fully functioning again. We will continue to work with the committee on a path forward.”  The committee, however, approved Trump’s nominations for EXIM’s first vice president, Kimberly Reed, and three other board members: former Louisiana congressman Spencer Bachus, Claudia Slacik and Judith DelZoppo Pryor. It also approved Mark Greenblatt as the agency’s inspector general. Confirmation of at least three board members will allow EXIM to resume approval of loans and guarantees above $10 million, returning the United States to export financing for major projects such as commercial aircraft, power turbines and  petrochemical plants for the first time since June 2015.  GE in a statement urged quick confirmation of the remaining EXIM nominees and hailed the committee vote as “a milestone for manufacturers across the U.S. whose customers require a fully-functioning EXIM Bank.” EXIM has a $42 billion backlog of deals in its pipeline awaiting approval, representing about 250,000 U.S. jobs based on Bureau of Labor Statistics multiplier data, said Scott Schloegel, an Obama administration appointee who still serves as the bank’s top officer.     Schloegel said with EXIM’s extended absence from large-scale export finance, many U.S. exporters have been unable to compete with China for some major projects in the power and technology sectors.

U.S. civil liberties group to challenge Trump's new travel ban,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The American Civil Liberties Union on Friday launched the first legal challenge to President Donald Trump’s new restrictions on people entering the United States from eight countries. The civil rights group said in a statement that it will seek to amend an existing lawsuit in Maryland federal court that was filed against Trump’s previous March 6 ban. In a letter filed with U.S. District Court Judge Theodore Chuang, the ACLU said the new proposal announced on Sunday violates the U.S. Constitution as well as federal immigration law. Trump’s new ban places indefinite restrictions on travel to the United States for citizens from Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad and North Korea. Certain government officials from Venezuela will also be barred.   The ACLU will seek an injunction that would block visa and entry restrictions on those affected. Challengers of Trump’s immigration restrictions have said the bans are aimed at following through on a pledge he made on the campaign trail in 2016 to block Muslims from entering the country. “President Trump’s newest travel ban is still a Muslim ban at its core, and it certainly engages in discrimination based on national origin, which is unlawful,” said the ACLU’s executive director, Anthony Romero. “We’ll see President Trump in court - again,” he added. The new ban, Trump’s third, could affect tens of thousands of potential immigrants and visitors. Trump has argued that the restrictions fulfill his campaign pledge to tighten immigration and security. “The Department of Justice will continue to vigorously defend the president’s inherent authority to keep this country safe,” said Justice Department spokesman Ian Prior. The ACLU represents several nonprofit groups, including the International Refugee Assistance Project as well as individuals who say they would be affected by the ban, which goes into effect on Oct. 18. Chuang was one of two district court judges who blocked Trump’s second travel ban, saying “it is likely that its primary purpose remains the effectuation of the proposed Muslim ban.” Legal experts say the new ban is likely on more solid footing than the previous bans, in part because it was implemented following a detailed review by federal agencies. Trump’s first travel ban aimed at seven Muslim-majority countries, issued soon after he took office in January, was blocked by courts following chaotic scenes at airports. The second ban, targeting six countries, was blocked by lower courts and partially revived by the Supreme Court in June. ",Government News,29-Sep-17,real

 Reporter Calls Out The Racist Writer Trump Invited To Press Briefing – Press Room Erupts In Chaos,"He may work for Fox Radio but this man deserves a ton of respect for what he just did. At a breaking point with Trump s love affair with the racist blog  The Gateway Pundit,  Fox Radio s Jon Decker openly and vehemently criticized the White House for allowing the website, which panders in fake right-wing conspiracies and racist rhetoric, to attend daily press briefings alongside legitimate news sources.Decker didn t hold back. Pointing directly at The Gateway Pundit s Lucian Wintrich, Decker noted that he and his site  hate blacks, Jews, [and] Hispanics  and don t deserve to be in the room. It was a moment where a reporter finally had enough of Trump s normalization of racism, white Nationalism, and xenophobic outlets like Gateway Pundit and Breitbart.The site s founder, Jim Hoft, is frequently referred to as  the stupidest man on the Internet  for his daily parade of false and idiotic coverage of politics. He has repeatedly ran stories that fail to hold up to even the most basic scrutiny and often deals in wild conspiracies. Trump may like them because they relentlessly suck up to him, but they are despicable liars who deal in misinformation and hate.After Decker called Wintrich out, chaos ensued:Fox News Radio John Decker just loudly told everyone in briefing room that Gateway Pundit is here ""they hate blacks, Jews, Hispanics."" Wild  Adrian Carrasquillo (@Carrasquillo) March 10, 2017He was speaking to Lucian Wintrich. He said it twice, pointing to him, so everyone knew who he was. https://t.co/42njWQQ0fX  Adrian Carrasquillo (@Carrasquillo) March 10, 2017Needless to say, Wintrich saw things differently. On Twitter, he whined that he was  assaulted  by Decker. Apparently being called a racist is tantamount to a sucker punch for the poor conspiracy theorist. He also (hilariously) misspelled the word  assault  several times, again highlighting the caliber of writer Trump personally gave a seat in the press briefing room.Jon Decker asulted me at today's briefing. @FoxNews   is this behavior something you tolerate over there? He's sick .https://t.co/gzZhhIzOMD pic.twitter.com/ThppoHpRQw  Lucian B. Wintrich (@lucianwintrich) March 10, 2017John Decker also asulted me, pushing me in the break room & then grabbing my arm in the briefing room while shouting that I'm a nazi. https://t.co/RiVM1yYCJv  Lucian B. Wintrich (@lucianwintrich) March 10, 2017Wintrich also said he would be pressing charges against Decker for  assult  and also for harassment   ironic because Trump s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski once claimed it was no big deal when he yanked the arm of a female reporter who had dared to ask Trump a question as he walked out of a rally.In a statement, Decker pointed out that at no point did he  assault  Wintrich, who appears to be lying. Earlier today I had a conversation with a representative from the online publication Gateway Pundit.  The conversation was straightforward and direct. I also informed the full White House pool that this representative was present in the Briefing Room. At no time did I accost or assault this individual. More than a dozen witnesses will attest to this fact. For Trump to be stopped, reporters as well as ordinary citizens need to stand up to the normalization of his descent into racism and xenophobia. Inviting a fear-mongering, disreputable smear merchant like The Gateway Pundit into the White House shows a level of disrespect for the American people that transcends politics. Kudos to Decker for standing up and loudly saying that it s not okay.Featured image via Twitter",worldnews,10-Mar-17,fake
 WATCH: 2 GOP Reps. Are COMPLETELY Stumped Over How Many Constituents They’ll Hurt With Trumpcare,"The House s plan to repeal and replace the ACA is catching an awful lot of flak from Republicans and Democrats alike. Congressmen Steve King of Iowa, and Leonard Lance of New Jersey, appeared on MSNBC last night to discuss Trumpcare, and Chris Hayes grilled them about how it will affect their constituents. Neither was able to give him a real answer.Hayes asked King: How many people in your district are on the [ACA] exchanges, congressman? King s answer was the answer of someone who neither knows nor cares about his constituents   only his power and position: I don t know that number. You may have that in front of you, Chris, but I don t know that number. Hayes pressed Lance on that, too, and Lance tried to pass it off as a small number:  I would say roughly 5,000 or so, Chris. The thing is, those numbers are readily available, so there s zero excuse for them not knowing these answers.Furthermore, an interesting picture emerged last night   In Lance s New Jersey district, more than 20,000 people have insurance through the ACA, but roughly 38,000 will lose their coverage under the GOP s plan. In King s district, a little over 11,000 people have insurance through the ACA, but over 40,000 stand to lose their coverage if the GOP s plan passes.So they re going to yank coverage away from more people than those who obtained it under the ACA. WOW. As U.S. Representatives, it s these guys  job to know this kind of thing about their districts so that they can support or oppose bills based on who they represent. They ve failed miserably.But they d rather put party and ideology above their people. And King even believes that people have no right to health insurance, which means no right to healthcare (because without insurance, most of us can t afford medical care). He also believes that the best decisions are made by lawmakers closest to the people, so he s shucking his responsibility as a U.S. Representative.Both of them are sick for this.Watch both segments below: Featured image via screen capture from embedded videos",worldnews,10-Mar-17,fake

FBI officials said Clinton 'has to win' race to White House: NYT,"(Reuters) - Senior FBI officials who helped probe Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign told a colleague that Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had to win the race to the White House, the New York Times reported on Tuesday.  Peter Strzok, a senior FBI agent, said Clinton “just has to win” in a text sent to FBI lawyer Lisa Page, the Times reported. The messages showed concern from Strzok and Page that a Trump presidency could politicize the FBI, the report said, citing texts turned over to Congress and obtained by the newspaper. nyti.ms/2AOHylP Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz is investigating the texts in a probe into FBI’s handling of its investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server for official correspondence when she was Secretary of State under former President Barack Obama, the report added. Strzok was removed from working on the Russia probe after media reports earlier this month suggested he had exchanged text messages that disparaged Trump and supported Clinton. Strzok was involved in both the Clinton email and Russia investigations. Republicans, including Trump, have in recent weeks ramped up their attacks on the FBI and questioned its integrity.  Special Counsel Robert Mueller and congressional committees are investigating possible links between Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia. Russia denies meddling in the 2016 U.S. elections.

"U.S. Energy Department grid study calls for boost to coal, nuclear power","WASHINGTON/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A U.S. Energy Department report calls for incentives to boost coal-fired and nuclear power plants following a slew of closures that it said undermined reliable sources of electricity.  The findings of the study, released late on Wednesday, drew praise from the coal and nuclear industries and a mixed reaction from renewable energy groups - some of which said the report’s recommendations could help them too.  President Donald Trump has promised to revive the ailing coal mining sector but has also said he welcomes all forms of energy development to shore up domestic production. Energy Secretary Rick Perry commissioned the grid study in April to evaluate whether “regulatory burdens” imposed by past administrations, including that of former President Barack Obama, had hurt the grid by forcing shutdowns of baseload plants, which provide nonstop power, like those fired by coal and nuclear fuel. Obama introduced regulations intended to slash emissions of carbon dioxide, which are blamed for climate change. This accelerated the retirement of coal-fired power plants and bolstered the nascent solar and wind sectors, which depend heavily on weather conditions for their power output.     “It is apparent that in today’s competitive markets certain regulations and subsidies are having a large impact on the functioning of markets, and thereby challenging our power generation mix,” Perry said in a letter introducing the study. “It is important for policy makers to consider their intended and unintended effects.” The study, conducted by the department’s staff, said cheap natural gas was the main driver of the closure of baseload coal and nuclear plants, a trend that was putting areas of the country at greater risk of power outages.  The department recommended giving baseload plants pricing advantages for their power, as well as making it easier and cheaper to get permits to build more such projects. The report differed from an earlier draft, which had said big increases in renewable power generation remained possible without undermining grid reliability, and which did not propose added support for baseload producers.  The administration had not yet reviewed the earlier draft, which was written by department staff.  Some coal and nuclear energy groups welcomed the final report’s findings. “This is a much-needed, pragmatic look at U.S. electricity reliability and resilience, including the priority of maintaining critical clean baseload power as electricity markets change,” said Rich Powell, director of ClearPath, which advocates for nuclear and hydropower. Renewable fuels supporters had a wide range of reactions. The Center for Biological Diversity called the report’s recommendations “dangerously misguided,” and the Sierra Club also bashed the study. But America’s biggest solar and wind power associations said they felt the study contained elements that were positive such as not singling out renewable energy as a big problem. “The report did not... lay the demise of coal at the feet of renewable energy, and that is an important finding,” Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, wrote in an email to the trade group’s members on Thursday. SEIA and other groups, including the American Wind Energy Association, said wind and solar could benefit from some of the report’s recommendations, such as a call for infrastructure development and market reforms. AWEA said in a blog post that technological advances could allow wind energy to provide reliability services, such as fast ramping to regulate the grid’s frequency signal. ",worldnews,24-Aug-17,real

During the interview, the Trump supporter and (until recently) CPAC headliner explained that he  is advocating  for man-on-child sex.Here is a longer cut where Milo Yiannopoulos says that he ""is advocating"" for legal sex between 13 year olds! & older men. #CPAC2017 pic.twitter.com/1fiuv7TSKs  The Reagan Battalion (@ReaganBattalion) February 19, 2017Though CPAC leadership has always been perfectly fine with Yiannopoulos claiming that Donald Trump grabbing women by the pussy isn t sexual assault and all the other horrific things he says and does, the conservative icon was disinvited following  the revelations about what sort of person he is. Even the vile white supremacists at Breitbart have decided that he might have gone too far   and these are the people who worked under President Steve Bannon!But what probably hurts most about all this for Milo, who calls Donald Trump  daddy,  is that he lost his precious book deal. Publisher Simon & Schuster announced Monday that Milo s precious book isn t happening anymore: After careful consideration, Simon & Schuster and its Threshold Editions imprint have cancelled publication of  Dangerous  by Milo Yiannopoulos. He s not taking this well. after apologizing for calling the 13-year-old boys he referenced  boys  rather than  young men,  the normally boisterous right-wing figure was reduced to simple sentences whining about what  his pedophilia advocacy has cost him:(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));They canceled my book.Posted by Milo Yiannopoulos on Monday, February 20, 2017 because he s the real victim here:(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));I've gone through worse. This will not defeat me.Posted by Milo Yiannopoulos on Monday, February 20, 2017Milo would complain on Twitter, but he has been banned from that platform ever since he led a racist mob attack on Saturday Night Live s Leslie Jones.Sadly, he probably will get through this given the enthusiastic response from conservatives, who don t care if Milo thinks it s OK to molest children:       Sorry, Milo   the free market has spoken, and its invisible hand slapped you across the face.Featured image via screengrab",politics,20-Feb-17,fake
 Trump Just Ridiculously Claimed Palestine And Israel ‘Get Along Unbelievably Well’ And Got ROASTED (VIDEO),"According to Donald Trump, Israel and Palestine get along just swell. Sure, Benjamin Netanyahu is a genocidal monster who makes Civil War hero Andrew Jackson seem like a swell guy and Israel has been oppressing the Palestinian people for seemingly forever at this point, but The Donald thinks things are just fine over there.During a press conference with State of Palestine President Mahmoud Abbas, Trump praised the Palestinian National Authority for working so well with Israel   a country whose army regularly slaughters Palestinian children. I also applaud the Palestinian Authority s continued cooperation with Israel,  Trump said.  They get along unbelievably well  They work together beautifully.

Trump: Israel & Palestinians  work together beautifully  Captain Truth (@TruthTeamOne) May 3, 2017Ultimately, though, Trump says Palestine is at fault for any strife with what is basically the equivalent of a noisy neighbor who sets up a target range in your backyard and uses your children as the targets, noting there can be  no lasting peace  until all Palestinian leaders speak out against hatred.Trump said nothing of Israeli leaders like former deputy speaker of the country s parliament, who cam under fire in recent years for calling for actual concentration camps. In a 2014 Facebook post, Feiglin said that Palestinians should be  concentrated  in  tent encampments  and the  formerly populated areas  to be  shelled with maximum fire power.  Any  nests of resistance  would then be  exterminated  in the  event that any should remain. Any civilians who are later allowed to stay in the area  will be required to publicly sign a declaration of loyalty to Israel, and receive a blue ID card similar to that of the Arabs of East Jerusalem. And, of course, similar to the special little badges Adolf Hitler made Jews wear. With leadership like this, how can the Palestinians not want to cozy up to Israel, right?

" Sean Hannity Just Openly Threatened Someone On Twitter, And It May Be A Fox News Exec","Is there some reason people like Donald Trump and his most ardent fans can t handle problems without making threats? Sean Hannity is publicly threatening someone after tweeting that he s been talking to lawyers about  libel, slander, defamation, tortious interference.  As an alleged journalist, he really ought to know what those words mean and not throw them around.He s also doing quite a bit of posturing about it, up to and including issuing this threat:Oh FYI, Whoever you are just remember, IP addresses are traceable. Get Ready.  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) May 1, 2017Many on that tweet assume he s referring to his sexual harassment accuser, Debbie Schlussel. However, this tweet suggests he s talking about whoever it is he thinks  the traitor  is at Fox News:This is way way way bigger than any one individual. https://t.co/ERvdrmUdeE  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) April 30, 2017Hannity recently gave an interview to Vanity Fair, in which he defended embattled co-president Bill Shine, who has been caught up in the sexual harassment investigation into Fox News. In it, he said there was a traitor at Fox News, and claimed to know who it is. After Bill O Reilly s ouster amid a sexual harassment scandal, people began saying that  they  were going to come after Hannity.Sure enough, Schlussel came forward saying that Hannity had been creepy with her. Hannity has repeatedly denied that he was even remotely inappropriate with her, and he and his followers seem to think that she s either an active participant in some grand conspiracy to shut down Fox News (and indeed, conservatives in general) entirely, or a pawn that  they  are using to take down every conservative there is.Honestly, he sounds too much like Trump, dropping saying on Twitter that he s got all this information and hinting that it could blow something wide open. Since he s a television personality, it s a little more likely that he s actually got something on someone (or a lot of someones), but then again he really does sound like Trump blowing hot air and this could wind up being a huge nothingburger.He shut down before he  said too much  to his Twitter audience, and is now simply saying,  stay tuned.  So he s hinting that he and his  team  are going to bust something wide open. Because the scandal at Fox News can t possibly be a culture fostered by serial harasser Roger Ailes (and probably other serial harassers), could it?Featured image by Gerardo Mora via Getty Images",worldnews,30-Apr-17,fake
U.S. partisan split widening over Russia probe: court documents,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives are refusing to endorse a Republican move to find out who paid the firm that commissioned a dossier alleging ties between Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia, a court document made public on Monday showed. The split was the latest sign of partisan feuding that current and former U.S. officials say is undercutting a House Intelligence Committee probe into allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Republicans on the committee earlier this month subpoenaed an unidentified bank for the last two years of records of the accounts of Fusion GPS, the political research firm that hired former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele to pull together the dossier on Trump. The move was an apparent effort to find out who had paid for the work that led to the dossier. The firm assures its clients it will not disclose their identities. A source familiar with the situation said the law firm Perkins Coie had retained Fusion GPS on behalf of Democrat Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee. “To aid in its representation of the Clinton presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee, Perkins Coie retained Fusion GPS, entering into an engagement for research services that began in April 2016 and concluded before the election in early November,” the source said. Perkins Coie’s involvement in paying for the research was first reported by the Washington Post on Tuesday. Last week, Fusion GPS sued the unnamed bank in federal court in Washington, requesting a court order to block the subpoena. In a Monday night court filing, lawyers for the House, saying they represented the Intelligence Committee, asked the court to reject Fusion’s request. The legal challenge was made without support from Democrats, throwing into further question a tradition of bipartisanship in Congress on intelligence issues. Democrats, who are in the minority, and some Republicans on the House panel, want to investigate Russia’s role in the 2016 election, as well as allegations that Trump’s team colluded with the Kremlin. Moscow has denied meddling in the election and Trump has denied collusion. Representative Devin Nunes, the Intelligence Committee’s Republican chairman, and his allies have focused instead on other issues, including the activities of Fusion GPS. Some Republicans, including Senator Charles Grassley, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, have charged that Fusion GPS took Russian money while compiling the dossier on Trump. “Domestic American clients paid for Fusion GPS to research Donald Trump, period. No Russian was involved, in any way, in the payment to Fusion GPS for this work,” Joshua Levy, an outside attorney for the firm, said in a statement to Reuters on Tuesday. A footnote in Monday’s court filing said that House lawyers went to court to enforce the subpoena with the authorization of the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the entire House. But it added that the House’s “Democratic Leader and Democratic Whip decline to support the Group’s position in this case.” Representative Nancy Pelosi is the House Democratic leader, and Representative Steny Hoyer is the Democratic whip. The top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, Representative Adam Schiff, was not immediately available for comment. In their court filing, the House lawyers argued that Fusion GPS had no right to quash a valid congressional subpoena. “The relief Plaintiff seeks is extraordinary and would directly impede an ongoing congressional investigation of the highest national importance,” they wrote in the filing. The filing confirmed that Nunes retained control of the committee’s Russia probe, despite saying in April he would step aside and let fellow Republican Representative Mike Conaway take charge. Nunes “did not ‘recuse’ himself from the investigation,” the document said. ",left-news,24-Oct-17,real
Republicans could lose U.S. House in 2018 over immigration fight: Bannon,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican infighting over the fate of immigrants brought illegally to the United States as children could be so vitriolic that the party loses control of the U.S. House of Representatives next year, Steve Bannon, a former adviser to President Donald Trump, said in an interview airing on Sunday. Bannon, whose far-right views on immigration, climate and trade helped shape Trump’s presidential campaign and his first months in office, was fired by the Republican president last month in a push to end factional fights within the White House. In an interview with the CBS program “60 Minutes,” Bannon predicted Republicans could lose control in the House in the 2018 congressional elections because of a looming battle over what to do about 800,000 immigrants known as “Dreamers.” Trump said last week he would scrap a program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, that allowed the young immigrants to live and work in America. Bannon supported ending the program, which had been put in place by Democratic former President Barack Obama. Trump gave the Republican-controlled Congress six months to come up with an alternative, saying he would “revisit this issue” if lawmakers could not agree. “I’m worried about losing the House now because of this,” Bannon told CBS. “If this goes all the way down to its logical conclusion, in February and March it will be a civil war inside the Republican Party,” he said. “And to me, doing that in the springboard of primary season for 2018 is extremely unwise.” Republicans are divided over the Dreamers. Some believe they are illegal immigrants who are taking American jobs, while others say they contribute to the country and deserve compassion. Bannon, who said he left the White House on his own terms, lashed out against “establishment” Republicans who have at times grappled with Trump, a real estate celebrity who had never before held elected office. “The Republican establishment is trying to nullify the 2016 election,” Bannon said, saying it was an “open secret on Capitol Hill” that many Republicans did not support Trump’s agenda, and singling out Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan for criticism.     “They do not want Donald Trump’s populist, economic nationalist agenda to be implemented,” Bannon said. He called Republican national security officials who had served in the George W. Bush administration “idiots,” including former secretaries of state Condoleezza Rice and Colin Powell, and former Vice President Dick Cheney. “I hold these people in contempt, total and complete contempt,” Bannon said, blaming them for U.S. trade problems with China and involvement in Iraq. “They’re idiots, and they’ve gotten us in this situation, and they question a good man like Donald Trump,” Bannon said.

" Trump Just Went Back On Another Election Vow, Decides To Keep DACA","In a shocking turn of events, the Trump administration has done something good. I know that s hard to imagine while Trump has been working to crackdown on immigration.According to the Washington Post, the Trump administration is leaving in place the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, a program protecting hundreds of thousands young immigrants from deportation. It s also the very same program Trump had pledged to eliminate as a presidential candidate.Crazy, right?Referred to as  dreamers,  these young immigrants arrived in the U.S. as small children and raised in the U.S. For them there is no recollection of their former home country. To protect these young immigrants from deportation to a land they do not know, the DACA program was launched in 2012 and has since protected about 787,000 young immigrants from deportation.Despite Trump s vow, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly quietly announced the decision to keep the program at the bottom of a fact sheet released late Thursday.Of course, there s a caveat to this program remaining in place. In the fact sheet, Kelly declared the end to Deferred Action for Parents of Americans, or DAPA, a similar, but never implemented program intended to shield immigrant parents of U.S. citizens and legal residents from deportation.No idea what made Trump and his administration change their mind on DACA but thankfully Obama s program will remain in place for young immigrants.Unfortunately, that s not the case for parents.DAPA was blocked by a federal judge in Texas after 26 states sued. The Washington Post goes on to say that  Republicans saw it as a  backdoor amnesty  and argued that Obama overstepped his authority by protecting a specific class of immigrants living in the United States illegally. Trump did mention in an Associated Press interview in April that his administration is  not after the dreamers, we are after the criminals  and  The Dreamers should rest easy. If that s the case, the question then becomes: why block it for parents? If they re not criminals, why shouldn t they get protection, too?Though we have a win, there s still much work to be done.Featured image via Diego G Diaz/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images",politicsNews,16-Jun-17,fake

 Trump Has Planted Spies To Ensure His Cabinet’s Loyalty – What He’s Calling Them Is TERRIFYING,"It s hard not to wonder just how paranoid and/or dictatorial Trump really is. One would think that, since he s the one appointing his cabinet, that he d be able to trust those secretaries to do their jobs according to how he wants them done. Apparently, though, that s not the case. Trump is so ridiculous that he s appointed many White House aides whose jobs are specifically to spy on the cabinet secretaries.All of these people have the title of  senior White House adviser,  and their offices are very close to their secretaries  offices. The point literally seems to be ensuring the cabinet secretaries  loyalty to Trump, seeing as how they report to the Office of Cabinet Affairs and not to the secretaries.But that s not all. That would be bad enough, but the White House has names for some of them that aren t  senior White House adviser.  For instance, the officer who s spying on General Mattis over at the Department of Defense is literally called  the commissar.  That s a reference to Soviet-era Communist Party officials whose task was just to ensure their commanders  loyalty.These people are embedded in every agency from the Departments of Defense and Health and Human Services to the EPA, even to NASA. They are in constant contact with the White House.Obama, Bush and Clinton did not use this kind of spy method to ensure their cabinets did exactly as they were told.And that s nuts. But one former Trump adviser actually thinks this is smart, which just illustrates the level of paranoia and authoritarianism that has existed inside Trump s circles even before he was elected: Especially when you re starting a government and you have a changeover of parties when policies are going to be dramatically different, I think it s something that s smart. Somebody needs to be there as the White House s man on the scene. Because there s no senior staff yet, they re functioning as the White House s voice and ears in these departments. We guess the secretaries themselves just aren t good enough.The funny thing is that the Trump administration is all up in arms about  the deep state,  and the alleged  shadow government  that Obama s supposedly running to oppose Trump. Yet, they re creating their own shadow government with these  advisers  who are supposed to spy on leaders to make sure they remain properly loyal.If Trump can t trust even his own appointees to be loyal without spies like this, then he has no business running the U.S. government. But we already knew that, and this is just the latest thing to prove that Trump is trying to position himself as Supreme Overlord of the United States, or something.Featured image by Andrea Morales via Getty Images",worldnews,20-Mar-17,fake
 Trump Goes On Insane Rant About Female News Anchor Bleeding; Here’s Her Response (TWEETS),"It can easily be said that there is a madman who has been allowed to take residence in the White House. A man with the maturity level of an awkward prepubescent pre-teen. A man who has been handed everything his entire life yet still feels entitled to bash others if they so dare criticize him and the work he supposedly does.As you all probably remember the horrible Megyn Kelly remarks he made about her bleeding out of her  wherever,  Trump has now decided to bash yet another news anchor and call her out on her bleeding, and this time it s MSNBC s Mika Brzezinski.In an early morning rage, clearly not happy with what was said about him on Morning Joe, albeit he says he wasn t watching yet clearly was, Trump tweeted: I heard poorly rated [Morning Joe] speaks badly of me (don t watch anymore).

" Steve Bannon THREATENS Trump Over Removal From National Security Council, Administration In CHAOS","Yesterday, the Trump administration delivered a bombshell that no one saw coming   that former Breitbart News chief Steve Bannon, who is now serving as Trump s White House strategist, was being kicked off the National Security Council. While Bannon released a statement that seemed neutral enough, it turns out that s not how he really feels at all   and Trump is in trouble.According to a new report by the New York Times, Bannon aggressively disagreed with the decision to demote him. In fact, he was apparently so pissed off over being booted off the council that he even threatened to completely leave his position in the administration. The Times wrote: Mr. Bannon resisted the move, even threatening at one point to quit if it went forward, according to a White House official who, like others, insisted on anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Mr. Bannon s camp denied that he had threatened to resign and spent the day spreading the word that the shift was a natural evolution, not a signal of any diminution of his outsize influence. Considering the fact that Bannon did not show up at Trump s press conference with Jordan s King Abdullah II, some bitterness on Bannon s part makes absolute sense.Bannon s position on the National Security Council has been controversial to begin with   it was a role he basically tricked Trump into giving him. Trump had signed off on an executive order without actually knowing what it said   and later got upset that he d accidentally and unknowingly given Bannon a position that he probably wasn t meant to have. Bannon had no relevant experience for a position on the National Security Council, but we all know that s hardly a prerequisite for a job in the Trump administration. Unfortunately for Trump, the White House is crumbling due to its own erratic, inexperienced staff.Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images",News,6-Apr-17,fake

" GOP Runs Out Of Good Things To Say About Trump: ‘He’s An Asshole, But He’s Our Asshole’","Republicans have spent the past two years insisting that Donald Trump really isn t a complete and utter moron in addition to being a raging bigot.  Just give him a chance,  conservatives have bellowed from the rooftops since he was sworn into office in January. But now, it seems that Trump s own party has run out of good things to say about him.Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter was speaking during a gathering with the Riverside County Young Republicans when the best thing he could come up with to say about Trump was that he may indeed be an asshole, but hey, at least he s our asshole. He put his hand near his mouth like when you are going to whisper something,  Jose Guzman told the Los Angelos Times. And then he decided what the hell and told the room how he really feels. He s just like he is on TV,  Hunter reportedly said to the group.  He s an asshole, but he s our asshole. When this is the best thing your own party can manage to say about you, you know your  presidency  is in big trouble. To make it even more pathetic, this isn t even someone who has been against Trump in his past. This is one of his supporters. Hunter endorsed Trump early on in the primaries not long after he won the Nevada caucuses.Let s all hope that conservatives like Hunter are as willing to own the messes Trump has created for both the country and the Republican party. Because Hunter is right on both counts. Trump is an asshole and he is their asshole. Trump is most definitely a monster the GOP created and they need to own that as well. Then, once they get a grip on that reality, they need to grow a pair and do something to stop him before he causes any more damage than he already has.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",worldnews,28-Aug-17,fake
 Angela Merkel’s Husband Is Taking Melania And Ivanka On A Tour That Will P*ss Trump Off,"While spouses are a tradition at the G-20 Summit, the truth is there is very little for them to do while world leaders discuss the problems facing the world. Donald Trump brought along more than just his spouse this time. He also brought along his daughter Ivanka, who in this instance, has absolutely no purpose. Angela Merkel s husband has an idea that might help change the world, though. He s taking the Trump women on a climate change tour, with the implied hope that perhaps they can have some influence over the man in their live.Donald Trump is proving himself to be one of the most destructive forces in the world in his denial of climate change. His pulling out of the Paris Climate Agreement put us in the position of being one of only three countries, and by far the biggest carbon emitter, that has not vowed to cut emissions.Merkel s husband Joachim Sauer is a chemist and a professor. Let s just say he doesn t share Trump s anti-science stances. His plan is to take the First Daughter and First Lady on a tour of a climate change lab.Sauer is reportedly planning to take US president Donald Trump s daughter, Ivanka Trump, and first lady Melania Trump, as well as the other spouses of G20 leaders, on a tour around a climate change lab. The spouses of G20 leaders will visit the German Climate Computing Center today (July 7), a facility that uses supercomputers to model climate change and map its effects across the world. Sauer will also be taking the spouses on a river cruise and sightseeing tour of Hamburg.I wish Sauer luck. You can bet that if either of these women have any sway with BLOTUS, it s Ivanka. She is at least somewhat scientifically literate, when it comes to climate change, and she has had absolutely zero influence.

Trump calls for boycott of television network CNN: tweet,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump urged a boycott of CNN on Wednesday, ramping up his fight against the television network as his administration fights AT&T Inc’s deal to buy CNN’s owner Time Warner Inc. Trump has criticized the proposed deal, which the Justice Department has sued to stop. Legal experts have said the president’s attacks on CNN could hobble his administration’s case. The president, who regularly assails mainstream media, has long criticized CNN, calling the network “fake news” and saying he no longer watches it, while lauding rival Fox News. His call for a boycott appeared to be a step up in his attacks. “Great, and we should boycott Fake News CNN. Dealing with them is a total waste of time!,” Trump wrote in a Twitter post. Trump was responding to a post by his spokeswoman Sarah Sanders, who in her own post on Tuesday night praised reports      that CNN would not attend an annual holiday party held at the White House for news media.  It was not immediately clear if Trump in his post was calling for a wider boycott against CNN or one by White House staff. Representatives for the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Representatives for CNN also did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump’s tweet on Wednesday. A CNN spokesperson told Politico that it would not attend the party “in light of the President’s continued attacks on freedom of the press and CNN” but would send a reporting crew to cover the event, Politico reported on Tuesday. The network and its journalists have repeatedly defended CNN’s work against previous presidential attacks.  The Department of Justice’s challenge is unusual move given that pay TV and wireless company AT&T does not directly compete with TV show maker Time Warner. The department has said the lawsuit is a law enforcement decision, not a political one. ",politics,29-Nov-17,real

Asked if the tweet is accurate, Comey explained that they have  offered no opinion, have no view, have no information on potential impact because it s never something that we looked at. This, of course, has been the FBI and NSA s position from the beginning and it has not changed. It it shameful that Donald Trump would attempt to misrepresent testimony in this way.

Senators seek to stop expansion of airport facial scans,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. senators on Thursday urged federal authorities to halt the planned expansion of a $1 billion airport facial scanning program, saying the technology used to identify travelers on some flights departing from nine U.S. airports for international destinations may not be not accurate enough and raises privacy concerns. Congress has approved the use of the program for non-U.S. citizens, but never expressly authorized its use for Americans. The Department of Homeland Security has said the system is needed to prevent travelers from leaving the country using someone else’s identity and to prevent visitors to the United States from overstaying their visas. Senators Mike Lee, a Republican, and Edward Markey, a Democrat, in a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, raised concerns that too many travelers would be inconvenienced by faulty scan results and questioned why Americans are being subjected to the screens, known as biometric exit detection technology.  In the letter, they raised objections to expanding the program beyond the nine airports where it is already in use. “We request that DHS stop the expansion of this program and provide Congress with its explicit statutory authority to use and expand a biometric exit program on U.S. citizens,” the senators wrote. “If there is no specific authorization, then we request an explanation for why DHS believes it has the authority to proceed” They cited a report released Thursday by Georgetown University Law School’s Center on Privacy & Technology that found DHS is conducting the scans “without basic legal and technical safeguards - or any meaningful justification of its billion-dollar cost.” Congress in 2016 authorized spending up to $1 billion over 10 years on the facial scans. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), on its website, says the program collects “facial images from all travelers from the United States” on a flight and uses the images to verify identities. It says the images are stored for no more than two weeks and says that “CBP is dedicated to protecting the privacy of all travelers.” The government said Thursday that U.S. citizens may opt out of the facial screening and instead have a separate review of their ID documents. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokeswoman said the government is working to establish the biometric exit program “in a way that’s most efficient and secure for the traveler and that is least disruptive for the travel industry.” Airports using the system include Boston, Las Vegas, Miami, New York’s John F. Kennedy, Washington Dulles, both Houston airports, Chicago O’Hare and Atlanta. The senators want DHS to provide data that the program will not unduly burden travelers. DHS said previously its goal is a 96 percent “true accept rate,” meaning the technology can positively identify 96 percent of the faces it scans. The senators, however, said this meant “there would still be a false denial for one in 25 travelers. Further there is evidence that certain face scans exhibit different error rate depending on the race or gender of the person being scanned.” DHS has said travelers who cannot be verified are escorted to another area where Customs and Border Patrol uses other methods to verify their identity. The Georgetown Law report also noted that DHS has not established any rules governing the program.  “It’s as if DHS has hired a billion-dollar bouncer to check IDs but never checked how good he is at spotting a fake,” said Laura Moy, deputy director of the center and co-author of the report. “They also don’t know if he’s biased against certain groups of people.” The senators said DHS also needed safeguards to ensure facial data is not shared with other U.S. agencies.

Mattis says does not have complete accurate information on Niger ambush,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Thursday the U.S. military did not have all the accurate information on an ambush in Niger earlier this month that killed four U.S. soldiers. “The loss of our troops is under investigation,” Mattis said before a meeting with his Israeli counterpart at the Pentagon. “We, in the Department of Defense, like to know what we are talking about before we talk and so we do not have all the accurate information yet.”  “We will release it as rapidly as we get it,” he added.

Trump campaign adviser was wiretapped under secret court orders: CNN,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. investigators wiretapped former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort under secret court orders before and after the 2016 election, CNN reported on Monday. The New York Times, citing two people close to the case, also reported that prosecutors told Manafort they planned to indict him. Federal agents had raided Manafort’s Virginia house in July. Manafort is one of several close advisers who helped President Donald Trump win the 2016 election and who are now being investigated as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of alleged Russian interference in the U.S. vote. Manafort became Trump’s campaign manager in June 2016 but was forced to resign two months later amid reports of his business relationship with the Kremlin-backed former Ukrainian leader, Viktor Yanukovich. Manafort’s attorney and the White House did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment on the stories. The secret court that oversees warrant requests under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act initially authorized monitoring of Manafort but discontinued it at some point in 2016 for lack of evidence, CNN said, citing one of its sources. The FBI resumed surveillance under a new FISA warrant at some point last year and continued to monitor him into 2017, CNN said. The second warrant was obtained as part of the FBI’s investigation into ties between Trump campaign associates and Russian operatives, it said. FISA warrants require the approval of top FBI and Justice Department officials, and law enforcement has to demonstrate to the court that there is reason to believe that the subject of the investigation may be acting as an agent of a foreign power. CNN said interest in Manafort deepened because of intercepted communications between him and Russian operatives, and among the Russians. The government eavesdropping continued into 2017, including a period when Manafort was known to talk to Trump after he became president. CNN said it was unclear if Trump was picked up on the surveillance. The FBI was not listening in June 2016 when Donald Trump Jr., Manafort and top White House adviser Jared Kushner met with a Russian lawyer who had promised to deliver negative information on Trump’s rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, CNN said. Russia has denied interfering in the U.S. election and Trump has denied there was collusion. ",politics,19-Sep-17,real
"Pentagon wants 12 month procurement time for major weapons programs, official","(Reuters) - The Pentagon’s acquisition chief said on Wednesday she wants to cut the time for major procurements to 12 months from an average of 2.5 years, speaking during a congressional hearing on the reorganization of the Defense Department’s procurement system. The Pentagon typically takes months and often years to make procurement decisions, especially for major weapons programs. A more rapid procurement process could accelerate the pace of orders for weapons makers like Lockheed Martin Corp and Northrop Grumman Corp. During the hearing of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, panel chairman Senator John McCain called the Pentagon’s buying program a “system of organized irresponsibility.” The Pentagon’s chief weapons buyer, Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Ellen Lord, was asked her goal for cutting back time for weapons procurement and she responded “12 months for major programs.” Lord, who began working at the Pentagon in August, was formerly chief executive of defense contractor Textron Systems, an aerospace and defense company that makes drones and missiles. If the acquisition process is shortened it would be good for larger weapons makers because time is money, Byron Callan, a defense analyst at Capital Alpha Partners, said in an interview. The move could also increase competition from smaller companies that often lack the financial resources to wait out lengthy Pentagon procurements, he said.  The Pentagon’s weapons procurement process generally begins by soliciting proposals from industry, often includes a competitive process to find a vendor, as well as product testing before delivery and final payment. Critics say the decision-making part of the current procurement process takes too long and could be reduced. Mark Esper, Secretary of the Army, said his office was examining a way to reduce the requirements development process, where the military articulates the concept of what it needs, to 12 months from five years. The 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) changed the structure of the Pentagon’s Office of Acquisition by splitting it into two new positions, an undersecretary for research and engineering focusing on innovation, and an undersecretary for acquisition and sustainment focusing on program management.  That process is still unfolding, but during the hearing testimony showed the initial effect was that decision making for some procurement processes had moved to individual branches of the U.S. military.

"Internet firms shift stance, move to exile white supremacists","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Silicon Valley joined a swelling backlash against neo-Nazi groups in the United States on Wednesday as more technology companies removed white supremacists from their services in response to weekend violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.  Social media networks Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and LinkedIn, music service Spotify Ltd and security firm Cloudflare Inc were among the companies cutting off services to hate groups or removing material that they said spread hate.  Earlier in the week, Facebook Inc (FB.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and GoDaddy Inc (GDDY.N) also took steps to block hate groups. The wave of internet crackdowns against white nationalists and neo-Nazis reflected a rapidly changing mindset among Silicon Valley firms on how far they are willing to go to police hate speech. Tech companies have taken down violent propaganda from Islamic State and other militant groups, in part in response to government pressure. But most internet companies have traditionally tried to steer clear of making judgments about content except in cases of illegal activity.  Cloudflare, which protects some 6 million websites from denial-of-service attacks and hacking, on Wednesday afternoon dropped coverage of the neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer. “I woke up this morning in a bad mood and decided to kick them off the internet,” Cloudflare founder and Chief Executive Matthew Prince said in an email to employees. Cloudflare is well-known for defending even the most distasteful websites, and services like it are essential to the functioning of websites. Daily Stormer helped organize the weekend rally in Charlottesville where a 32-year-old woman was killed and 19 people were injured when a man plowed a car into a crowd protesting the white nationalist gathering.  Daily Stormer has been accessible only intermittently the past few days after domain providers GoDaddy and Google Domains, a unit of Alphabet, said they would not serve the website.  By Wednesday, Daily Stormer had moved to a Russia-based internet domain, with an address ending in .ru. Later in the day, though, the site was no longer accessible at that address.  Daily Stormer publisher Andrew Anglin said on a social network used by many of his supporters, Gab, that his site would be back soon.  “The Cloudflare betrayal adds another layer of super complexity. But we got this,” he said. He could not immediately be reached for further comment.  Prince, the Cloudflare chief executive, said in an interview that despite his decision he was conflicted, because it could become harder to resist pressure from governments to censor. “You don’t have to play this game too many moves out to see how risky this is going to be,” Prince said. “‘What about this site? What about this site?’” Only the biggest companies will be able to navigate the varying laws in different countries, he added. “We’ve lost a lot of the fight for a free and open internet.” Twitter on Wednesday suspended accounts linked to Daily Stormer. The company said it would not discuss individual accounts, but at least three affiliated with the Daily Stormer led to pages saying “account suspended.”  The social network prohibits violent threats, harassment and hateful conduct and “will take action on accounts violating those policies,” the company said in a statement.  Larger rival Facebook Inc (FB.O), which unlike Twitter explicitly prohibits hate speech, has taken down several pages from Facebook and Instagram in recent days that it said were associated with hate speech or hate organizations. It also took down the event page that was used to promote and organize the “Unite the Right” rally. “With the potential for more rallies, we’re watching the situation closely and will take down threats of physical harm,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote on Wednesday.      Facebook also said it had removed accounts belonging to Chris Cantwell, a web commentator who has described himself as a white nationalist and said on his site that he had attended the Charlottesville rally. Cantwell’s YouTube account also appeared to have been terminated. Cantwell could not immediately be reached for comment. LinkedIn, a unit of Microsoft Corp MSFT.N, suspended a page devoted to Daily Stormer and another page belonging to a man associated with the site, Andrew Auernheimer. LinkedIn declined to comment.  Reddit this week eliminated one of its discussion communities that supported the Unite the Right rally, saying that the company would ban users who incite violence. The company says it has more than 250 million users.  Spotify, based in Sweden, said it was in the process of removing musical acts from its streaming service that had been flagged as racist “hate bands” by the Southern Poverty Law Center. “Illegal content or material that favors hatred or incites violence against race, religion, sexuality or the like is not tolerated by us,” the company said in a statement, adding that record companies should also be held responsible.

" Trump To Gut Coast Guard, Airport Security, And FEMA To Fund Useless Border Wall","Donald Trump s obsession with building a massive expensive wall along the Mexican border is literally going to make America less secure.Despite claiming that he will beat back terrorism and keep Americans safe, Trump is drafting a budget proposal that would cripple three of the nation s most critical agencies that do way more to help Americans than any wall will ever do.The cost of Trump s wall is projected to reach past $20 billion. During the campaign, Trump repeatedly claimed that Mexico would pay for the wall, but it s clear now that American taxpayers will be footing the bill. And rather than create a new budget item, Trump is considering just cutting funding from existing national security and national emergency management agencies to use it to pay for the wall instead.On the chopping block includes the U.S. Coast Guard, a crucial branch of the military that patrols and secures our ports, coast lines, and waterways, defending them from potential terrorist attacks and rescuing people.This particular cut is fiercely opposed by Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter, who explained on CNN Wednesday why the Coast Guard is too important to slash. You have President Trump talking about security, criminal networks   that s what the Coast Guard does, literally!  Hunter said.  So how can the president talk about  stopping illegal immigration, illegal drugs, and criminal narco networks, and then say we re going to cut the military and cut the Coast Guard? The way you stop bad things from happening here is not directly on the border, necessarily. So this is nonsensical to me. But that s not all.According to the Washington Post,The proposal, drawn up by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), also would slash the budget of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which provides disaster relief after hurricanes, tornadoes and other natural disasters. The Coast Guard s $9.1 billion budget in 2017 would be cut 14 percent to about $7.8 billion, while the TSA and FEMA budgets would be reduced about 11 percent each to $4.5 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively.In regards to the Transportation Security Administration, Trump plans to cut post-9/11 programs, which includes a program that trains airline crews how to deal with hijackers, a program that funds the use of special law enforcement teams that sweep transportation hubs for potential threats prior to and during major events like an inauguration, a program that gives local law enforcement more ability to patrol in and around airports, and a program that funds the use of special TSA agents who are trained to specifically detect people exhibiting odd behavior at check-points.In other words, programs that  have been considered a vital piece of airport security and for preventing a repetition of the Sept. 11, 2001, hijackings So Trump is literally looking to sacrifice programs designed to prevent another 9/11 in order to build a wall that most experts consider useless in stopping immigration.Donald Trump is once again demonstrating that he cares more about himself than he does about the safety and security of the American people. The Coast Guard protects our coastal boarders from inside and outside threats. The TSA helps prevent another 9/11 attack from occurring on American soil. And FEMA responds to help Americans before, during, and after a disaster strikes. Gutting these agencies doesn t make America safer. It makes us more vulnerable and that appears to be exactly what Trumps wants.If it wasn t clear enough before, it definitely is now. Trump is the greatest threat to our national security.Featured image via Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images",worldnews,8-Mar-17,fake
 Trump Suggests White Anti-Semites NOT Attacking Jews – Who He Thinks It Is Will Make You Sick,"There s been a spate of attacks on Jews around the U.S. recently, including destroying Jewish cemeteries and issuing bomb threats to Jewish community centers and synagogues. Trump did condemn rising anti-Semitism, but when asked about this growing threat earlier today, he suggested that something else could be happening. And it s just flat-out sick.In a meeting with several states  attorneys general, he said: Sometimes it s the reverse, to make people or to make others look bad. While he hasn t clarified what he actually means by this, it sounds pretty clear. He thinks either that the Jewish community itself is doing this (why, we don t know), or liberals are behind this to frame his white nationalist, Neo-Nazi, KKK and anti-Semitic followers. He said it was  reprehensible,  according to Pennsylvania s attorney general, but it s clear he d rather believe in some kind of conspiracy than the fact that his supporters include people who want to eradicate everyone who isn t straight, cis, white and Christian.BREAKING: PA Attorney General: Trump told us  sometimes it s the reverse,  when asked about anti-Semitic threats and attacks. pic.twitter.com/Pjo8FE59iN  Chris Geidner (@chrisgeidner) February 28, 2017Shapiro says Trump used the word  reverse  two or three times in his remarks. That really does imply that he thinks Jews might be doing this to themselves (for what? Sympathy? Come on) because what s the reverse of being an attack victim? Being the attacker. How vile and sick do you have to be to suggest that?The White House, however, claims he didn t suggest that at all. They did say that he thinks protesters probably his phantom professional liberal protesters are behind it. However, it s kind of odd that this sort of mirrors what former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke has also said about the attacks:Trump echoes David Duke, suggests Jews are behind threats to Jewish schools https://t.co/zcPMJsmWpJ pic.twitter.com/ccJRQhat3b  Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) February 28, 2017Trump is a sick piece of worm-infested shit.
